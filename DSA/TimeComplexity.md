Code code is one that is:
1. READABLE
2. SCALABLE

Scalability is the ability of a software to grow as the data(input) increases.
Scalability calculated using:
1. Time Complexity.
2. Space complexity.

Time Complexity is calculates using Big O.
Cheat sheet for Big O:
1. O(1) -- Constant time : Statement / one line of code
2. O(n) -- Linear time : single for-loop/while-loop for n items
3. O(log n) -- logarithmic : divide and conquer algorithms
4. O(nlog n) -- log linear : sorting algorithms
5. O(n^2) -- Quadratic : two nested loops
6. O(2^n) -- Exponential : Recursive alogrithms having n sized input
7. O(n!) -- Factorial : adding a loop for every element!
8. O(n^3) -- three nested loops!
